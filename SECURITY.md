# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main`  | ✅ |

Please report vulnerabilities against the `main` branch. Older commits are unsupported once fixes land on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Do **not** create a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.
2. Instead, open a private security advisory using GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” workflow **or** email `security@rozling.dev`.
3. Include:
   - A description of the issue and affected paths/files.
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within 2 business days and to provide a remediation ETA within 7 business days.

## Disclosure Process

1. We validate the report and reproduce the issue.
2. A fix is developed, reviewed, and landed on `main`.
3. A release and CHANGELOG entry describe the impact and mitigation.
4. With the reporter’s consent, we credit them in the release notes.

Thank you for helping keep the Assimil8or preset validator secure!***
