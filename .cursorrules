# Cursor Rules for a8-validate

## Python Environment
- Always use the virtual environment located at `venv/` or `.venv/` when available
- Prefer `venv/bin/python` for Python execution
- When running commands, activate the virtual environment first or use `venv/bin/python -m <command>`
- For pip installs, use `venv/bin/pip install` or `python -m pip install` from within the venv

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use black for code formatting (120 character line length)
- Use isort for import sorting (black-compatible profile)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Run flake8 before committing (with max-line-length=120, extend-ignore=E203,W503)

## Testing
- Run tests using `pytest` from the virtual environment
- Test command: `venv/bin/pytest -v --tb=short` or `python -m pytest -v --tb=short`
- All tests are located in `a8_validate/tests/`
- Ensure all 49 tests pass before committing

## Dependencies
- Production dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Development dependencies are in `requirements-dev.txt`
- Never add `wave` to requirements.txt (it's a standard library module)
- Always use `venv/bin/pip` for installing dependencies

## File Structure
- Main validation code: `a8_validate/`
- CLI script: `validate_directory.py`
- Utility scripts: `scripts/`
- Tests: `a8_validate/tests/`

## Git Workflow
- Run pre-commit hooks before committing
- Ensure all CI/CD checks pass (Tests, Lint, Coverage, Security)
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes

## Code Quality
- Remove unused imports
- Remove unused variables
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add docstrings for public functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate
