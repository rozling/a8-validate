# GitHub MCP fallback

When a **GitHub MCP** action fails (e.g. `issue_read`, `create_pull_request` returns an error, 422, or "refs not readable"):

1. **Retry the operation using the `gh` CLI** instead of giving up or only suggesting manual steps.
2. **Tell the user** that the MCP call failed and that the gh CLI was used (or suggest they run the gh command if gh is not available).

Common equivalents:

- **Read issue:** `gh issue view <N> --repo <owner>/<repo>`
- **Create PR:** `gh pr create --base main --head <branch> --title "..." --body "..."`
- **List PRs:** `gh pr list`

If using `gh`, ensure it is authenticated (`gh auth status`). If `gh` is not installed or auth fails, report that and give the user the manual URL or command to run.
